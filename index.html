<p><em>Surf</em> is an open source framework for simplifying system development on AWS. <em>Surf</em> is used for collecting data across multiple technologies (messaging, logging, applications, etc.) to <em>Amazon Kinesis</em>. It also enables rapid development of Kinesis applications that are based on collected streaming data.</p>

<p><em>Surf</em> can be deployed as a server connecting to several devices at once. Or it can be used as a library, providing an abstracted view of <em>Kinesis</em> API. <em>Surf</em> has a small run-time footprint and is easily extensible. We intend on keeping it up-to-date with emerging user requirements and active projects.</p>

<p>Innovation in IoT/M2M space comes from two areas – <em>devices</em> and <em>applications</em>. The connectivity fabric, operations, scaling, application integration and other platform capabilities are critical for a functioning system, but not differentiating.</p>

<p>Today such platform capabilities are commonly provided either by Telecoms or by purpose-built products. In either case, the platforms severely limit developer’s abilities to experiment, leverage open-source community, and scale-as-you-go.</p>

<p>We believe that the combination of open-source frameworks and operational simplicity of AWS provides a powerful alternative to proprietary IoT/M2M platforms.</p>

<p><em>Surf</em> is our initial step towards open source IoT/M2M frameworks.</p>

<p>Our objective is to extend <em>Surf</em> as practical requirements emerge. Please, contribute your thoughts and commentaries on our Forum <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/projectsurf">here</a>.</p>
